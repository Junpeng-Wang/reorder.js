{"name":"Reorder.js","tagline":"JavaScript library to reorder matrices","body":"### Welcome to `Reorder.js`\r\n\r\nReordering, also known as _seriation_, and _linear ordering_, consists in assigning an order to rows/columns of\r\na table or to vertices of a network to reveal structures.  When visualizing a table as a heatmap or when visualizing a network as an adjacency matrix, finding a good order is essential to revealing high-level patterns in the data.  The literature on reordering algorithms is dense but few implementations are easily available. \r\n\r\n`Reorder.js` is a novel JavaScript library, provided in source code with a BSD license, which provides several of these algorithms and variants to facilitate the use, adoption, and experimentation of these algorithms.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
